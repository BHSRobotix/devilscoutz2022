<h3>TODO - implement this REPORTS screen</h3>
This screen is probably a set of links to other reports
whose components still need to be made.  Reports might
be something like:
<ul>
  <li>Team list (also accessible from main menu?)</li>
  <li>Individual team report, gives all details</li>
  <li>Match Report - gives summary of each team in our next / specified match</li>
  <li>Alliance Selection Helper - summary of all teams in sortable table with strikethrough?</li>
  <li>Any other reports we think of</li>
</ul>
